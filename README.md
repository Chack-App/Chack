  <h3 align="center">Chack</h3>

  <p align="center">
    A mobile event management and payment application
    <br />

Let's be honest, We all love to go out with friends, but sometimes it can be a big pain, especially when it's time to figure out the check. When youâ€™re out with a large group, often times one person is stuck putting down their card. No one enjoys the task of figuring out what everyone owes and making sure that if youâ€™re putting your card down, that youâ€™re getting paid back the right amount. Chack makes it easy to track what everyone ordered, calculate what each person should be paying, and finally, collect payments so that you can focus on having a great time with your friends.
